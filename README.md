# Third Task.




## Today I've learned about markdowm and github repos.
 ### Markdown is:
  * A markup language that formats plain text. The formatted text is then converted into another language, such as HTML.
  * every major blogging platform supports Markdown, and many platforms offer modified versions of Markdown.
 
 # Markdown quick reference
    Section headings
    Headings are indicated by prefixing a line with between one and six hash marks (#). The resulting text corresponds to the HTML entities <h1> through <h6>.
 
 # Emphasis and strikethrough
      bold ,italic, and Strikethrough.
      
 ## you can also put
   * link.
   * lists.
   * codes.
   * images.
## and you can publish it on the internet using github pages and select a theme ðŸ˜ŒðŸ˜Œ.

there is many things on this language you can learn it from here [markdown language](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/).


## Remote Repositories

    In order to collaborate on Git projects, you must interact with remote repositories, versions of a project residing online or on a network. You can work with multiple repositories, for which you can have read/write or read-only privileges. Teams can use remote repositories to push information to and pull data from.
